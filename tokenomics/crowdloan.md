# ðŸ‘¥ Crowdloan

LAOS conducted a Crowdloan campaign from April 20th to April 29th to secure a parachain slot on Polkadot, raising nearly 100K DOT from over 360 accounts. Crowdloans support community involvement and the ecosystem's growth, thus expanding the network's community of token holders.

From the campaign, around 1,000,000 LAOS tokens (\~1% of the initial supply) are reserved for Crowdloan rewards, at a rate of 100 LAOS per DOT contributed. As specified in the [token distribution section](token-distribution.md), these rewards will be <mark style="color:green;">**released via a linear vesting mechanism**</mark> that will last for 24 months, aligned with the lease period, to ensure that LAOS has enough time to build an ecosystem around the parachain.

In line with our earlier announcement, the remaining 4% of the initially allocated 5% will remain part of the Community Incentives pool.
