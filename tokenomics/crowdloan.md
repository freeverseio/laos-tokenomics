# ðŸ‘¥ Crowdloan

LAOS aims to enable an efficient and transparent crowdloan campaign, <mark style="color:green;">**allowing participants to contribute and acquire tokens**</mark>. For this LAOS will provide a streamlined process for <mark style="color:green;">**locking, contributing, and redeeming tokens**</mark>, which will encourage community participation and investment in the ecosystem's growth, leading to an increase in the network's community of token holders

To incentivize support, <mark style="color:green;">**a maximum of 5% of the total LAOS supply will be set aside as crowdloan rewards**</mark>, aimed at encouraging contributions to secure the LAOS Network's parachain. Any <mark style="color:green;">**unused rewards will remain part of the LAOS Community Incentives pool and can be designated for other purposes**</mark> as applicable within the framework of the token allocation.

As specified in the [token distribution section](token-distribution.md), the Crowdloan rewards will be <mark style="color:green;">**released via a simple  linear vesting mechanism**</mark> that will last for 24 months, aligned with the lease period, to ensure that LAOS has enough time to build an ecosystem around the parachain. These rewards are sourced from the LAOS Community Incentives pool, ensuring the total supply of LAOS remains unchanged.
