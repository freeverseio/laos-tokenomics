# ⚖️ Token Distribution

At genesis, the LAOS Foundation will create an <mark style="color:green;">**initial total token supply of 1,000,000,000 LAOS**</mark> tokens.&#x20;

## LAOS Token Allocation&#x20;

The LAOS token allocation is designed to ensure a fair and balanced distribution that <mark style="color:green;">**supports both the development and longevity of LAOS**</mark>. We aim to <mark style="color:green;">**stimulate active participation, reward contributors, and incentivize stakeholders**</mark> in a manner that aligns with our community-centric ethos.&#x20;

Please find <mark style="color:green;">**detailed information regarding the specific percentage breakdown for the allocation below**</mark>. The allocated tokens will be released according to a predetermined schedule to maintain market stability.

In order to <mark style="color:green;">**maintain flexibility for a potential public sale in the future**</mark>, we have reserved a portion within the community incentives/distribution allocation. Should LAOS decide against a public sale, this reserved amount will be redirected towards further community incentives, thereby enhancing the value of the ecosystem while concurrently advancing our mission of decentralization.

<table><thead><tr><th width="307.3333333333333">Stakeholder</th><th>Token Allocation</th><th>%</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Core Team</td><td>220,000,000</td><td>22.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Investors</td><td>200,000,000</td><td>20.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Foundation/Community Treasury (with pocket for Public sale)</td><td>230,000,000</td><td>23.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Community Incentives/Distributions</td><td>350,000,000</td><td>35.0%</td></tr></tbody></table>

To accommodate different fundraising scenarios, an option is retained to allocate up to 8% of the investor portion for "Future Sales." This reserve will be valued during the private round and allocated proportionally to participants. Any tokens not distributed in this category will be set aside for potential future fundraising rounds or a public sale.

### LAOS Token Vesting  <a href="#laos-token-vesting" id="laos-token-vesting"></a>

The LAOS token vesting process utilizes a release schedule to <mark style="color:green;">**maintain the project's long-term stability**</mark>. This schedule outlines the timeline for tokens allocated to various stakeholders to gradually become accessible. This approach <mark style="color:green;">**safeguards against sudden market flooding, encourages ongoing commitment, and protects the LAOS token value**</mark>. It embodies our commitment to transparency, fairness, and sustainable growth within our ecosystem.

Next, you'll encounter a detailed table highlighting the <mark style="color:green;">**specifics of our vesting process**</mark>. Tailored to meet the unique needs and contributions of each stakeholder, this approach ensures an equitable distribution.

<table><thead><tr><th width="301">Stakeholder</th><th width="139">Cliff (months)</th><th width="151">Linear (months)</th><th>Total Lock-up</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Core Team</td><td>12</td><td>36</td><td>4 Years</td></tr><tr><td>Investors</td><td>12</td><td>24</td><td>3 Years</td></tr><tr><td>Foundation/Community Treasury (with pocket for Public sale)</td><td>0</td><td>36</td><td>3 Years</td></tr><tr><td>Community Incentives/<br>Distributions</td><td>0</td><td>24</td><td>2 Years</td></tr></tbody></table>

Our <mark style="color:green;">**commitment to early decentralization becomes evident when analyzing the circulating supply**</mark>. Initially, the liquid token supply is fully in the hands of the community. As tokens allotted to investors and core team members progressively unlock, the community's share incrementally decreases. However, it always maintains at least 60%, <mark style="color:green;">**ensuring LAOS remains sufficiently decentralized at all times**</mark>.&#x20;
