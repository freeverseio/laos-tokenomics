# üë©‚Äçüíª Developer Groups / Freeverse

In our strong commitment to decentralization, we're harnessing the <mark style="color:green;">**collective prowess of independent developer groups**</mark> contributing to LAOS.&#x20;

LAOS firmly believes in building its technology with the active participation and expertise of these independent groups, fully acknowledging the <mark style="color:green;">**immeasurable value they can bring to the ecosystem**</mark>. By entrusting the development efforts and possibilities to a diverse array of innovative groups, we are creating the optimal environment for LAOS to emerge as the leading solution in the dynamic NFT space.&#x20;

To enable this decentralized contribution environment, <mark style="color:green;">**LAOS has set aside**</mark> [**40% of its token for community incentives**](../tokenomics/token-distribution.md#laos-token-allocation). These tokens will be distributed through comprehensive programs that include grants and payouts for community contributions. By focusing on community empowerment, we aim to foster a flourishing ecosystem of smart builders, ensuring that the tokens are distributed widely among those who contribute to the growth and success of LAOS.
