### LAOS Foundation

The LAOS Foundation is a non-profit organization, established in Zug, Switzerland, since Summer 2023.

Its  mission is to promote the growth of a decentralized ecosystem and support cutting-edge technologies and applications in the field of Digital Ownership, putting LAOS capabilities at work to scale other mature blockchains, and empowering creators and users alike.

The LAOS Foundation aims to lead the change towards a future where digital assets reach the mainstream user, are truly alive, evolving, certified on-chain across all blockchains, and legislation-compliant.

### The Future of the Foundation

The LAOS Foundation will initially issue the LAOS token and, as governance becomes decentralized, help implement the actions approved by the LAOS governance.&#x20;

It will be committed to promoting the use of the platform, as well as to <mark style="color:green;">**funding and supporting the continued development of innovative projects**</mark> that align with our mission to be the home of all dynamic NFTs.
